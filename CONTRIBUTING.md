### Code Style

Please follow the coding style used in the project. We use `gofmt` to format our Go code.

Also semantic-release is being used for automated releases, so please ensure your commits are following [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification).

You don't need to install most of the tools if you use VSCode, because there is a dev container.
